Serious security flaws in a car's ECU have the potential to injure or kill drivers if exploited by malicious actors. For this reason, it would be unethical and unacceptable for the auto manufacturer to release this car with the known vulnerabilities. I would tell my boss first, of course. If the company decided to fix the issues before production, that would be the end of the issue. If they decided to put the vehicle in production with the flawed ECU's, I would consider telling consumer watchdog organizations or investigative media outlets. Should I fail to act in this situation, I would have some responsibility for allowing a situation to develop which could put others in harm's way. By releasing information about the ECU, I could possibly create enough public pressure to force the company to fix the vulnerabilities; failing this, I would at least give consumers the information they need to make an educated decision and protect themselves.

If I leaked these vulnerabilities, it would obviously increase the likelihood of malicious actors learning to exploit them. However, if I can find these vulnerabilities then so can someone else, therefore there was already a good chance of these vulnerabilities being discovered. If we assume the worst case scenario, which I believe would be prudent in this case, then it would only be a matter of time before the vulnerabilities would be discovered. Thus, leaking the vulnerabilities would be more ethical than doing nothing to prevent the flawed ECU from going to production.
